# Birdor — Calm, Developer-First Tools & Notes

**Birdor** is a quiet, friendly hub for developers.
We build **practical tools**, **clear engineering notes**, and **small guides** that help you understand modern software — without noise, tracking, or dark patterns.

Birdor is designed to be:

* **Calm** — no ads, no popups, no distractions
* **Fast** — lightweight, client-first tools that run in your browser
* **Practical** — real-world engineering notes and examples
* **Honest** — clear trade-offs, straightforward explanations
* **Developer-first** — optimized for people who write code every day
